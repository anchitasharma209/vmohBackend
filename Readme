# VMOH Backend

This is the backend server for the VMOH project, implemented using Node.js and Express.js. It uses Mongoose to interact with the database.

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.

## Running the Server

To start the server, run:
`npm run dev`

## For Future Reference

No `.env` is being used up until now; configuration will be implemented later on.
